//Button Scanning routine by Brad Rogers, 10th March 2021.
//Free for all reuse

//In this example, we're using 4 buttons, they'll be attached to inputs 2,3,4,5 in a pulldown resistor config. We'll be making them active HIGH. 
//In this instance the coder will implement their own loop which will repeatedly call the alt subroutine while doing other stuff like updating LEDs or running stepper motors.
//The way this works is that each button will add a value to keypad total. Keypadtotal will remain at 0 when no buttons are pressed.
//Each button will be assigned a value. If multiple keys are pressed, those values will add, which can be handy for multi keypress requirements.
//The values of each button will be spaced out in such a way that 2 buttons pressed together won't add to a value that would signify a third button that the user isn't pressing. Ie, 10, 50, 100, 200. 

//THIS VERSION IS GOING TO SCAN FOR KEYPRESSES WITHOUT LOCKING THE PROGRAM IN THE FUNCTION ONLY, We'll do "other stuff" in void loop while checking for keys

//Note: the serial routines can be commented out or removed once you're confident that things are working. They're there to ensure program flow is as I want it to be. 

//NOW, for the code:

//Set the pins we'll be using for all 4 buttons
int buttonA = 2;
int buttonB = 3;
int buttonC = 4;
int buttonD = 5;

//Define the variables used to store whether each button is pressed
int buttonAstate=0;
int buttonBstate=0;
int buttonCstate=0;
int buttonDstate=0;

//define the variable and zero it, for keypad total. This will help us indicate simultaneous keypresses, if your program is looking for that.
int keypadtotal=0;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

//Set the serial port. Comment this out if you're removing all the serial statements. We're only using this for debug, and demonstrating to you.
Serial.begin(9600);

//For the pins we're connecting the buttons to, we need to define them as inputs:
pinMode(buttonA, INPUT);
pinMode(buttonB, INPUT);
pinMode(buttonC, INPUT);
pinMode(buttonD, INPUT);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
//In this main program, all we're doing is doing a bunch of serial printing of what the user is pressing, and calling the keypadcheckloop, of which we'll stay in that function until a key is pressed.

Serial.println("I'm in void loop");
keypadcheckonce();
Serial.println("I'm also doing other stuff in the void loop while checking for keypresses");
Serial.print("My Keypad total is: ");
Serial.print(keypadtotal);
Serial.println();
}


void keypadcheckloop(){
// This funtion is mostly here for show, we're not using it in void loop in the demo, however it's here if you wish to manually modify the code. 
do
{

//you can get rid of this delay, it's just there to make serial readout a bit easier on the eyes
delay(100);

keypadtotal =0;
Serial.println("I'm in lock loop");

buttonAstate = digitalRead(buttonA);
if (buttonAstate!=0){
  keypadtotal = keypadtotal + 10;
}

buttonBstate = digitalRead(buttonB);
if (buttonBstate!=0){
  keypadtotal = keypadtotal + 50;
}

buttonCstate = digitalRead(buttonC);
if (buttonCstate!=0){
